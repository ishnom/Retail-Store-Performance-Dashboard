# 🛍️ Retail Store Performance Dashboard

## Project Overview  
This project showcases an **interactive Retail Store Performance Dashboard** built using historical retail sales data across multiple fiscal years (**FY13–FY16, partial FY17**).  
The dashboard is structured into **three interconnected layers**: **Summary**, **Overview**, and **Detail**, enabling both high-level business monitoring and granular transaction analysis.

Due to incomplete data for **FY17**, Year-over-Year (YoY) analysis is performed by comparing **FY16 vs FY15** for sales and profit.
